1.The Stack, the heap, and the static. The static stores the global variables, the stack stores the local variables, and the 
heap stores the dynmic storage. 
2.
	a.Three Variables are declared.	
	b.There are 2 pointers and pointer ptr points to variable num, and pointer handle points to pointer ptr.
	c.Stack Memory
	d.Heap Memory
3.Done
4.Done
1.The code makes the object head which then sets ivalue = 5 and value = 3.14.
2.Done
3.The variables are stored very close to each other in a small group.
