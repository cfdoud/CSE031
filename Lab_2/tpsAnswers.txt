1.gcc -o punish punishment.c
2.gdb start 
3.gdb run
4.gdb break punishment.c:(line number). Breakpoints make the program stop wherever I point it too.
5. Type next repeatedly to bo line by line.

Tps Activity 3
1.4 variables and 2 pointers(px,py).
2.x = 0, y=1, arr[0]=0, I think y would equal one because since we didn't set a value it would automatically
 give it a value following the zero
3.We would have to set the values of the variables to zero, including the array.
4.printf("x-address = %p, y-address = %p \n", &x, &y);

8.Yes, because it would have to default the very first address where it is zero, compared to where we declared the exact 
location we would also need the &symbol.
